# Bedrock-Custom-Door-Template
this is a template that adds custom doors to bedrock using scripting without HCF

all you should need to do is use the door ive made as a template and add your own identifier and change the textures in the block permutation. you should also probably add destroy time and stuff like that but this is just the bare basics of a door.

keep in mind, this template is not redstone compatible due to the lack of redstone related features in the scripting API.
